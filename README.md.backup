## Implementation
This project was implemented using React and TypeScript/JavaScript. 

Specs the projects fulfilled:

* The user is able to move blocks into the blank space to try to solve the puzzle.
* The puzzle behaves like a physical puzzle in that one can push an entire row/column or segment of a row/column into the blank space.

Work in progress for the project:

* Cleaning up the styling.
* Refactoring the code

Specs the project does not fulfill:

* No moving and dragging (I would have used Godot if I wanted this functionality, as there are built-in collision detection mechanis)
